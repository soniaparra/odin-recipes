    <h2>Japanese Rice Balls!</h2>
    <p>Also known as o-musubi or nigirimeshi,onigiri are Japanese rice ball snacks made from cooked or steamed sushi
        rice, furikake seasonings (and sometimes tasty hidden fillings), wrapped a nori seaweed wrapper.</p>
    <p>In Japan, they're either made at home in the morning or purchased from a nearby kombini (convenience store), then
        taken to work or school as a tasty snack or quick lunch.</p>


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Koshihikari Rice</li>
        <li>Furikake</li>
        <li>Nori</li>
    </ul>


    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pop your cooked rice into a nice mixing bowl. Add the furikake or rice flavouring and mix through evenly.
            Separate the rice into equal portions, big enough to be a large handful each.</li>
        <li>Wet your hands with water and rub together with a pinch or two of salt. This stops the rice sticking to your
            hands and helps keep it fresher for longer.</li>
        <li>Take up one portion of rice in your hands.</li>
        <li>If you are hiding some fillings inside, here is where you make an indent, place the ingredients inside and
            fold the rice over, then lightly press into a ball.</li>
        
    </ol>
