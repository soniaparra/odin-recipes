    <h2>What is Bulgogi?</h2>
    <p>Literally speaking, bulgogi (불고기) means “fire meat”. It is often made with tender parts of beef, pork or chicken.
        However, in general terms, unless specified, bulgogi is made with beef.</p>
    <p>Undoubtedly it is one of the most well-known Korean traditional foods and it has been around for thousands of
        years. Naturally, the cooking method of bulgogi evolved over time and it varies by region too.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Steak</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Green Onion and Garlic</li>
        <li>Sesame Seeds</li>
        <li>Sesame Oil</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the flank steak in a shallow bowl. In a separate bowl, combine the rest of the ingredients and whisk
            until blended. Pour the marinade over the steak — make sure the meat is completely covered. Cover the bowl
            and allow the beef to marinate in the fridge for about an hour.</li>
        <li>On a lightly oiled grill set to high heat, cook the beef until it's charred and completely cooked through.
            This should take about 1 or 2 minutes on each side. </li>
    </ol>
